      <h1>Why do people do this?</h1>
      
      
      <p> People poison dogs for many reasons which seem very ridiculous to me.
      Some people kill dogs for only barking at them,and this shows how cruel & non modern is our society.
       Just if everybody revises what he does before doing its consequencec.<p>
       
       <h2>How do they kill them? 
       And the goverment situation against killing animals.</h2>
       
            
        <p2>
      People poison animals especially dogs by poisons,but now some people gone mad and started killing them with guns infront of every body.
      This is not the only problem as people sell animals poisons with less than quarter of the cost of there medicines.
      Which incourages people who hate dogs to kill and get rid of dogs.</P2>
       
     <h3>What should we do and our responsibilitys to them as they have a sole like us</h3>
     
     <p3> Just imagine that by only playing or feeding them they will love you ,I mean is there any real problem of giving street animals the rest of your food 
     insted of throwing them or hurting animals for no reason.</p3>
